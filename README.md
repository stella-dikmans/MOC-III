For our last challenge we will need to create a Human Interface for the Museum of Colonization. To optimize our efforts and align our intentions with the future of the Museum of Colonization (MOC) we had these 3 points as key considerations to guide our approach for this last challenge:

- **Feedback from MOC Tour**, the final design intervention fro MDEF Festival: We conducted the MOC Tour twice in the past weeks to gather some feedback from participants. Valuable insights emerged from the last tour: 1) highlighted the importance of using historical facts to discuss current systems of oppression; 2) To enhance the tour experience, we recognized the need for a more hands-on, engaging, and interactive approach; 3) we acknowledged that the walking distance to the Gato de Botero, where we address immigration issues, might be too long for some participants.
- **Collaboration with EXPLORINS:** We recently initiated a collaboration with EXPLORINS, an organization specializing in interactive phygital experiences for cultural dynamization. As we focus on this collaboration, we were approached to develop a map on their platform. Recognizing the potential of this partnership, we are focused on using these resources and knowledge to enhance and leverage the MOC project.
- **Inclusivity and Funding:** To make the project more appealing to funding and support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) individuals, we plan to open a call for 3D artists to contribute their artwork to the various tour spots. Our collaboration with EXPLORINS and the search for funding will enable us to continue collaborating beyond our graduation, a very important and big goal for the group.

To kickstart the process, we have analyzed our existing tour, mapped, described and translated the seven stops into the Explorins platform. We have uploaded the map and this Friday we will have a meeting with the team to get valuable feedback and determine the next steps forward. Together, we are excited to shape the future of the MOC project and create an immersive experience that challenges colonial thought and inspires meaningful dialogue.

After completing the tour mapping, our focus shifted towards enhancing its fun and interactive elements. The MOC prototypes - the stamp button and the ticket machine - because they are in a very early stage of development are quite unpredictable artifacts to carry to the Festival tour. With the received feedback from the initial tour, we made the choice of adopting a low-tech approach for the creation of a sticker book. This book serves as a space where individuals can intuitively and individually record their thoughts, notes, and feelings.

For the cover of our sticker book we decided to go with a marble acrylic paint technique. We conducted various experiments to play with the amounts of alcohol, acetone, acrylic paint, cooking oil and spirulina powder.

Within the sticker book, you will have the opportunity to delve into your thoughts and inner world as the MOC team guides you on the tour. It is designed to be accessible, with gentle prompts, interesting facts, and playful stickers to engage with. The focus is on fostering an enjoyable and thought-provoking experience for participants.
